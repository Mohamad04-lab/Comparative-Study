## Overview
This project provides a detailed comparative study of six popular object detection models: **RCNN, Fast RCNN, Faster RCNN, SSD, YOLOv7, and DETR**. The study evaluates their performance, accuracy, speed, and practical applications across different datasets.

## Models Covered
1. **RCNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks)**
2. **Fast RCNN**
3. **Faster RCNN**
4. **SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector)**
5. **YOLOv7 (You Only Look Once - Version 7)**
6. **DETR (DEtection TRansformer)**

## Objectives
- Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each model.
- Compare their performance in terms of accuracy (mAP), speed (FPS), and computational efficiency.
- Evaluate real-world applications and trade-offs.
- Provide insights into choosing the best model for different use cases.

## Methodology
1. **Dataset Selection**: Multiple benchmark datasets such as COCO and Pascal VOC.
2. **Model Implementation**: Each model was trained and tested under the same conditions.
3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - **Mean Average Precision (mAP)** for accuracy comparison.
   - **Frames Per Second (FPS)** for speed analysis.
   - **Computational Cost** in terms of FLOPs and memory usage.
4. **Visualization & Analysis**: Results were presented using tables, charts, and detection sample images.

## Results Summary
| Model       | Accuracy (mAP) | Speed (FPS) | Best Use Case |
|------------|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| RCNN       | High          | Slow        | High-precision tasks |
| Fast RCNN  | High          | Faster than RCNN | Moderate-speed applications |
| Faster RCNN| Very High     | Faster than Fast RCNN | Real-time applications with accuracy focus |
| SSD        | Moderate      | Fast        | Real-time object detection |
| YOLOv7     | High          | Very Fast   | High-speed applications with good accuracy |
| DETR       | High          | Moderate    | Transformer-based object detection |

## Key Findings
- **YOLOv7** offers the best trade-off between speed and accuracy for real-time applications.
- **Faster RCNN** remains a strong choice when accuracy is prioritized over speed.
- **DETR** introduces transformer-based detection but requires more computational resources.
